Intro: [C]
 
[C] don't you worry, there my honey
[F] we might not have any money                           
[Am] but we've got our love to pay the F bills
[C] maybe I think you're cute and funny,
[F] maybe I wanna do what bunnies [Am] do with you,
if you know what I [F] mean
                                                          
Oh, [C] let's get rich and [E] buy our parents [F] homes in the South of [C] France
let's get rich and give every[E]body nice sweaters
and [F] teach them how to [G] dance
let's get [C] rich and build our [E] house on a mountain
making [F] everybody look like [D] ants
from way up [C] there, you and [F] I, [G] you and [C] I

well you might be a bit confused
and [F] you might be a little bit bruised
but [Am] baby how we spoon like no one [F] else
so [C] I will help you read those books
if [F] you will soothe my worried looks
and [Am] we will put the lonesome on the [F] shelf
