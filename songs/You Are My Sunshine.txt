Intro: [C]

You are my [C] sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me [F] happy when skies are [C] grey
You'll never [F] know dear, how much I [C] love you
Please don't [C] take my [G] sunshine a-[C]way 
(stop)

The other [C] night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I [F] held you in my [C] arms
When I a-[F]woke, dear, I was mis-[C]taken
So I [C] hung my [G] head and [C] cried. 
(stop)

You are my [C] sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me [F] happy when skies are [C] grey
You'll never [F] know dear, how much I [C] love you
Please don't [C] take my [G] sunshine a-[C]way 
(stop)

I'll always [C] love you and make you happy
If you will [F] only say the [C] same
But if you [F] leave me and love [C] another
You'll re-[C]gret it [G] all some [C] day
(stop)

You are my [C] sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me [F] happy when skies are [C] grey
You'll never [F] know dear, how much I [C] love you
Please don't [C] take my [G] sunshine a-[C]way 
(stop)

You told me [C] once, dear, you really loved me
And no one [F] else could come be-[C]tween
But now you've [F] left me to love a-[C]nother
You have [C] shattered [G] all of my [C] dreams
(stop)

You are my [C] sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me [F] happy when skies are [C] grey
You'll never [F] know dear, how much I [C] love you
Please don't [C] take my [G] sunshine a-[C]way
