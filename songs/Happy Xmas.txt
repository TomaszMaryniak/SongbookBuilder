So this is [A] Christmas
And what have you [Bm] done
Another year [E7] over
And a new one just [A] begun
               
And so this is [D] Christmas
And I hope you have [Em] fun
The near and the [A] dear one
The old and the [D] young

Chorus:             
A very merry [G] Christmas
And a happy New [A] Year
Let's hope it's a good [Em7] one [G]
Without any [D] fear [E7]
               
And so this is [A] Christmas
For weak and for [Bm] strong
For rich and for [E7] poor ones
The world is so [A] wrong
             
And so happy [D] Christmas
For black and for [Em] white
For yellow and red [A] ones
Let's stop all the [D] fight

Chorus:
A very merry [G] Christmas
And a happy New [A] Year
Let's hope it's a good [Em7] one [G]
Without any [D] fear [E7]

Verse:
And so this is [A] Christmas
And what have you [Bm] done?
Another year [E7] over,
And a new one just [A] begun

We hope you had [Em] fun
The near and the [A] dear one
The old and the [D] young

Chorus:
A very merry [G] Christmas
And a happy New [A] Year
Let's hope it's a good [Em7] one [G]
Without any [D] fear [E7]

Bridge:
[A] War is over,
[Bm] If you want it
[E7] War is over
[A] Now
[A] War is over,
[Bm] If you want it
[E7] War is over
[A] Now
