I am the passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city back streats
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah in the bright and hollow skies
You know it looks so good tonight

I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the cities ripping sky
And everything looks good tonight

Give in to the power
We’ll be the passsengers

We’ll see the bright and hollow sky
We’ll see the stars that shine so bright
The stars made for us tonight

Oh the passenger
Oh how you ride
Oh the passenger
He rides and he rides
He looks through his window - sing it faster at this bit -
And what does he see
He sees the bright and hollow sky
He sees the stars come out tonight
He sees the cities ripped back sides
He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
And it just belongs to you and me
So lets take a ride and see what’s mine

Are you the passenger
He sees things from under glass
He looks through his window side
He sees the things he knows are his
He sees the bright and hollow sky
he sees the city sleeping at night
He sees the stars are out tonight
And all of it is yours and mine
And all of it is yours and mine
So lets all ride and ride and ride and ride
