[Am] [F] [C]
[Am] [F] [C]

(single strum)
You [Am/] are, my [F/] fi[C/]re
The [Am/] one, de[F/]si[C/]re
Be[Am/]lieve, when [F/] i [C/] say
[Am/] I want it [G/] that [C/] way

But [Am] we, are [F] two [C] worlds 
[Am] Apart, can't [F] reach [C] to 
Your [Am] heart, When [F] you [C] say
That [Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

(Chorus)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take)
Tell me [F] why, i never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

Am [Am] I your [F] fi[C]re
Your [Am] one de[F]si[C]re
I [Am] know it's [F] too [C] late
But [Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take)
Tell me [F] why, i never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [E7] that way

[Am] Now i can see that we've [C] fallen apart
From the [F] way that it used to [Dm] be [G] yeah
No [Am] matter the distance, i [C] want you to know 
That [F] deep down inside of [G] me

(single strum)
You [Am/] are, my [F/] fi[C/]re
The [Am/] one, de[F/]si[C/]re
You [F/] are, you are, [G/] you are, [C/] you are (stop)

Tell me [G] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [A]heart[Bm]ache)
Tell me [G] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [A]mis[Bm]take)
Tell me [G] why, i never wanna [A] hear you [Bm] say
I want it [A] that [D] way
Tell me [G] why, ain't nothin' but a [A]heart[Bm]ache
