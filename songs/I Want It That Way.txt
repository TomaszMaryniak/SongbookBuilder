(single strum)
You [Am/] are .. my [F/] fi[C/]re
The [Am/] one .. de[F/]si[C/]re
Be[Am/]lieve .. when [F/] I [C/] say
[Am/] I want it [G/] that [C/] way

But [Am] we .. are [F] two [C] worlds 
[Am] Apart .. can't [F] reach [C] to 
Your [Am] heart .. when [F] you [C] say
That [Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

(Chorus)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take)
Tell me [F] why, I never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

Am [Am] I .. your [F] fi[C]re
Your [Am] one .. de[F]si[C]re
I [Am] know .. it's [F] too [C] late
But [Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take)
Tell me [F] why, I never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [E7] that way

[Am] Now i can see that we've [C] fallen apart
From the [F] way that it used to [Dm//] be [G//] yeah
No [Am] matter the distance, i [C] want you to know 
That [F] deep down inside of [G/] meeeee

(single strum)
You [Am/] are, my [F/] fi[C/]re
The [Am/] one, de[F/]si[C/]re
You [F/] are, you are, you [G/] are, you [C/] are (stop)

(riff) Don't want to hear you

[F] Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache
[F] Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take
[F] I never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

(Chorus)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] heart[Am]ache)
Tell me [F] why, (Ain't nothin' but a [G] mis[Am]take)
Tell me [F] why, i never wanna [G] hear [C] you say
[Am] I want it [G] that [C] way

(quietly single strums)
â€˜Cause [Am/] i want it [G] that [C/] way
