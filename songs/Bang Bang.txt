[Am] I was five and he was six
[Dm] We rode on horses made of sticks
[G] He wore black and I wore white
[E7] He would always win the fight

(chorus)
Bang [Am] bang     
He shot me down bang [Dm] bang    
I hit the ground [G] bang bang
That awful sound [E7] bang bang
My baby shot me [Am] down

[Am] Seasons came and changed the time
[Dm] When I grew up I called him mine
[G] He would always laugh and say
[E7] Remember when we used to play

Bang [Am] bang     
He shot me down bang [Dm] bang    
I hit the ground [G] bang bang
That awful sound [E7] bang bang
My baby shot me [Am] down

[Am] Music played and people sang
[G] Just for me the church bells rang

[Am] Now he's gone I don't know why
[Dm] And till this day some times I cry
[G] He didn't even say goodbye
[E7] He didn't take the time to lie

Bang [Am] bang     
He shot me down bang [Dm] bang    
I hit the ground [G] bang bang
That awful sound [E7] bang bang
My baby shot me [Am] down
