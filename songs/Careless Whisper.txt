(intro)
[Dm]... [Gm]... [Bbmaj7]... [Am]...
[Dm]... [Gm]... [Bbmaj7]... [Am]...

(verse)
[Dm] I feel so un-[Gm]-sure 
As I [Bbmaj7] take your hand
And lead you [Am] to the dance floor 

[Dm] As the music dies
[Gm] Something in your eyes 
[Bbmaj7] Calls to mind a silver screen 
And [Am] all its sad goodbyes

(chorus)
[Dm] I'm never gonna dance again 
These [Gm] guilty feet have got no rhythm 
[Bbmaj7] Though it's easy to pretend 
I [Am] know you're not a fool 

I [Dm] should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And [Gm] waste the chance that I'd been given 
[Bbmaj7] So I'm never gonna dance again 
The [Am] way I danced with you

[Dm]... [Gm]... [Bbmaj7]... [Am]...

(verse)
[Dm] Time can never [Gm] mend 
The [Bbmaj7] careless whispers
[Am] Of a good friend 

[Dm] To the heart and mind 
[Gm] Ignorance is kind 
[Bbmaj7] There's no comfort in the truth 
[Am] Pain is ALL YOU'LL find.

(chorus)
[Dm] I'm never gonna dance again 
[Gm] guilty feet have got no rhythm 
[Bbmaj7] Though it's easy to pretend 
I [Am] know you're not a fool 

I [Dm] should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And [Gm] waste the chance that I'd been given 
[Bbmaj7] So I'm never gonna dance again 
The [Am] way I danced with you

[Dm]... [Gm]... [Bbmaj7]... [Am]...

(bridge)
[Dm] Tonight the music seems so loud 
I [Gm] wish that we could lose this crowd 
[Bbmaj7] Maybe it's better this way 
We'd [Am] hurt each other with the things we'd wanna say 

We [Dm] could have been so good together 
We [Gm] could have lived this dance forever 
But [Bbmaj7] now who's gonna dance with [Am] me?
Please stay!

(chorus)
[Dm] I'm never gonna dance again 
These [Gm] guilty feet have got no rhythm 
[Bbmaj7] Though it's easy to pretend 
I [Am] know you're not a fool 
  
I [Dm] should've known better than to cheat a friend 
And [Gm] waste the chance that I'd been given 
[Bbmaj7] So I'm never gonna dance again 
The [Am] way I danced with you

[Dm]... [Gm]... [Bbmaj7]... [Am]...
