Intro: 
[C]... [C]...

I have [C] climbed.. highest mountain..
I have run.. through the fields
Only to [F] be with you... only to [C] be with you..

[C] I have run.. I have crawled..
I have scaled.. these city walls..
These city [F] walls.. only to [C] be with you..

But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for..
But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for..

[C] I have kissed.. honey lips
felt the healing in her.. fingertips
It burned like [F] fire.. this burning de[C]sire..

[C] I have spoke with.. the tongue of angels
I have held the.. hand of a devil
It was warm in the [F] night.. I was cold as a [C] stone..

But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for..
But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for..

[C] I believe in the.. kingdom come
Then all the colours will.. bleed into one
Bleed into [F] one.. well yes I'm still [C] running..

[C] You broke the bonds and you.. loosed the chains
Carried the cross.. of my shame
of my [F] shame.. You know I be[C]lieve it..

But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for
But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for
But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for
But I [G] still haven't [F] found what I'm [C] looking for
