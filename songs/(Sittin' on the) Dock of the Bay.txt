[G] Sittin' in the morning [B7] sun   
I'll be [C] sittin' when the  evenin' [A] comes   
[G] Watching the ships roll [B7] in   
And I [C] watch 'em roll away a-[A]gain   
{c:}  
[G] Sitting on the dock of the [E7] bay  
watching the [G] tide roll a-[E7]way   
I'm just [G] sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay wastin' [G] time [E7]    
{c:}  
I [G] left my home in [B7] Georgia   
[C] Headed for the 'Frisco [A] bay   
'Cause [G] I had nothin to [B7] live for   
And look like [C] nothing's gonna come my [A] way   
{c:}  
So I'm just gonna [G] Sit on the dock of the [E7] bay 
watching the [G] tide roll a-[E7]way   
I'm [G] sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay wastin' [G] time [E7]    
{c:}  
[G] Look [D] like [C] nothing's gonna change   
[G] E-e-[D]-verything [C] still remains the same   
[G]  I can't [D] do what [C] ten people tell me [G] to do   
[F]  So I guess I'll re-[D]main the same   
{c:}  
[G] Sittin' here resting my [B7] bones   
And this [C] loneliness won't leave me [A] alone   
It's [G] two thousand miles I [B7] roamed   
Just to [C] make this dock my [A] home   
{c:}  
Now, I'm just [G] Sittin' on the dock of the [E7] bay 
watching the [G] tide roll a-[E7]way   
[G] Sittin' on the dock of the [A] bay wasting [G] time [E7]    
{c:(whistling to fade) (No singing - just gentle playing) }  

[G] Sittin' on the dock of the [E7] bay, watching the [G] tide roll a-[E7]way
