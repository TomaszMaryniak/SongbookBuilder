Intro: [C] [Cmaj7] [Dm] [Dm7//] [G7//] 

[C] Hold me close and hold me [Cmaj7] fast 
The magic spell you [Dm] cast
This is La Vie En [Dm7] Rose  [G7]  
[Dm7] When you kiss me heaven [G7] sighs
And though I close my [Dm] eyes
I see La Vie En [Dm7] Rose [G7]  

[C] When you press me to your [Cmaj7] heart
I'm in a world a-[Dm]part
A world where roses [Dm7] bloom

[Dm7] And when you speak, angels [Em] sing from above
[Dm7] Everyday words seem to [G7] turn into love songs

[C] Give your heart and soul to [Cmaj7] me   
And life will always [Dm7] be - La [G7] Vie En [C] Rose.
