TODO: intro

[Am] Words like violence
[Cm] Break the silence
[F] Come crashing in
[F] Into my little world
[Am] Painful to me
[Cm] Pierce right through me
[F] Can't you understand
[F] Oh my little girl

[Dm] All I ever wanted
[F] All I ever needed
[Am] Is here in my [C] arms
[Dm] Words are very [F] unnecessary
[Am] They can only do [F] harm [F]...

TODO: intro

[Am] Vows are spoken
[Cm] To be broken
[F] Feelings are intense
[F] Words are trivial
[Am] Pleasures remain
[Cm] So does the pain
[F] Words are meaningless
[F] And forgettable

[Dm] All I ever wanted
[F] All I ever needed
[Am] Is here in my [C] arms
[Dm] Words are very [F] unnecessary
[Am] They can only do [F] harm [F]...
