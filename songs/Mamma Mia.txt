[C] I've been cheated by you since I don't know [F] when
[C] So I made up my mind, it must come to an [F] end
[C] Look at me now, [C+] will I ever learn?
[C] I don't know how [C+] but I suddenly [F] lose control
There's a fire with- [G7] in my soul 
[F/] Just [C/] one [G] look and I can hear a bell ring
[F/] One [C/] more [G] look and I forget everything, o_o_o_oh

(quiet:)
[C] Mamma mia, here I go again
[F] My my, how can I resist you?
[C] Mamma mia, does it show again?
[F] My my, just how much I've missed you

(loud:)
[C] Yes, I've been [G] broken-hearted [Am] Blue since the [Em] day we parted
[F] Why, why [Dm] did I ever [G7] let you go?
[C] Mamma mia, [Am] now I really know,
[F] My my, [Dm] I could never [G7] let you go

[C] [C+] [C] [C+]

[C] I've been angry and sad about the things that you [F] do
[C] I can't count all the times that I've Told you we're [F] through
[C] And when you go, [C+] when you slam the door
[C] I think you know [C+] that you won't be a- [F] way too long
You know that I'm [G7] not that strong 
[F/] Just [C/] one [G] look and I can hear a bell ring
[F/] One [C/] more [G] look and I forget everything, o_o_o_oh

(quiet:)
[C] Mamma mia, here I go again
[F] My my, how can I resist you?
[C] Mamma mia, does it show again?

(loud:)
[C] Yes, I've been [G] broken-hearted [Am] Blue since the [Em] day we parted
[F] Why why [Dm] did I ever [G7] let you go?
[C] Mamma mia, even if I say
[F] Bye bye, leave me now or never
[C] Mamma mia, it's a game we play
[F] Bye bye doesn't mean forever
[C] Mamma mia, here I go again
[F] My my, how can I resist you?
[C] Mamma mia, does it show again?
[F] My my, just how much I've missed you

[C] Yes, I've been [G] broken-hearted [Am] Blue since the [Em] day we parted
