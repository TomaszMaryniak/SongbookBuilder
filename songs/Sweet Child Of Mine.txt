[Bb]do-do do-do do-do do-do
[F] Do-do do-do do-do do-do 
[C] do-do do-do do-do do-do

[C] She's got a smile that it seems to me
Re[Bb]minds me of childhood… memories
Where [F] everything was as fresh as the bright blue [C] sky

Now and then when I see her face
She [Bb] takes me away to that… special place
And if I [F] stared too long I’d probably break down and [C] cry

[G] Ooh [Bb] oh sweet child o’ [C] mine
[G] Oh oh-oh [Bb] oh sweet love of [C] mine

[F] Do-doooooooo do-do-do do-do-do do-do-do
[C] Doooooooooooooooooo do-do-do

[C] She’s got eyes of the bluest skies
As [Bb] if they thought of rain
I [F] hate to look into… those eyes and [C] see an ounce of pain

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where [Bb] as a child I’d hide
And [F] pray for thunder and the rain to [C] quietly pass me by

[G] Ooh [Bb] oh sweet child o’ [C] mine
[G] Oh oh-oh [Bb] oh sweet love of [C] mine

[G] Oh oh-oh [Bb] oh sweet child of [C] mine
[G] Ooooo[Bb] ooh sweet love of [C] mine
