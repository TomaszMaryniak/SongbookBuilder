Em My lover's got Am humour Em
                            
She's the giggle at a Am funeral G
                            
Knows everybody's disa[Am]pproval Em
                                
I should've worshipped her Am sooner Em
                     Am     Em
If the Heavens ever did speak
                     Am      G
She is the last true mouth piece
                        Am      Em
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
                Am    D
a fresh poison each week
                   C                      Em 
'We were born sick, you heard them say it
                      Am    Em
My church offers no absolutes
                             Am    G
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                         Am   Em
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                   Am   D
Is when I'm alone with you
               C
I was born sick, but I love it

Command me to be well
G      C     G       Cm       G      Cm G   G Em
Aaaaaaaaa    aaaaaaaaamen. Aaaaaaaamen. Amen

Chorus:
              Em
Take me to church                 
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                       Am G G Gb
Good God, let me give you my life

Verse -same as first-:
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Chorus:
              Em
Take me to church                 
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                       Am G G Gb
Good God, let me give you my life

Bridge:
C            G                B7           Em
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
        C            G             B7           Em
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        C            G          B7           Em
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     C          G          
Only then I am human


      B7           Em     D     C
Only then I am clean


G      C     G   Cm  G    Cm G   G Em
Amen. Amen. Amen

Chorus:
              Em
Take me to church                 
                                               B
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                G
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Am
Offer me that deathless death
     Em                       Am G G Gb
Good God, let me give you my life
