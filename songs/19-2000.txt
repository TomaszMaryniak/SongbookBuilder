[G] The world is spinning too fast
[F] I'm buying lead Nike shoes
[C] To keep myself tethered
[G] To the days I tried to lose

[G] My mamma said to slow down
[F] You must make your own shoes
[C] And stop dancing to the music
[G] Of Gorillaz in a happy mood.

[G] There's a monkey in the jungle
[F] Watching a vapor trail
[C] Caught up in the conflict
[G] Between his brain and his tail

[G] And if time's elimination
[C] Then we've got nothing to lose
[C] Please repeat the message
[G] It's the music that we choose
