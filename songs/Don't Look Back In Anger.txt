[C] [F] [C] [F] 

[C] Slip inside the [G] eye of your [Am] mind
Don't you [E7] know you might [F] find [G] 
A better place to [C] play [G]
[C] You said that [G] you'd never [Am] been
But all the [E7] things that you've [F] seen [G] 
Slowly fade a-[C]way [G]  

[F] So I start a revo-[Fm]lution from my [C] bed [C]
'Cos you [F] said the brains I [Fm] had went to my [C] head [C]
[F] Step outside, the [Fm] summertime's in [C] bloom [C]
[G] Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7] Take that look from off your face
'Cos [Am] you ain't ever [G] gonna burn my [F] heart out [G] 

[C] So [G] Sally can [Am] wait
She [E7] knows it's too [F] late
As she's [G] walking on [C] by [G]
Her [C] soul [G] slides a-[Am]way  
[E7] But don't look [F] back in anger [G] 
I heard you [C] say [G]

[C] Take me to the [G] place where you [Am] go
Where [E7] nobody [F] knows
[G] if it's night or [C] day [G]
[C] Please don't put your [G] life in the [Am] hands
of a [E7] rock and roll [F] band
[G] Who'll throw it all a-[C]way [G]

[F] So I start a revo-[Fm]lution from my [C] bed
'Cos you [F] said the brains I [Fm] had went to my [C] head
[F] Step outside, the [Fm] summertime's in [C] bloom
[G] Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7] Take that look from off your face
'Cos [Am] you ain't ever [G] gonna burn my [F] heart out [G] 

[C] So [G] Sally can [Am] wait, she [E7] knows it's too [F] late
as she's [G] walking on [C] by [G]
Her [C] soul [G] slides a-[Am]way, [E7] 
but don't look [F] back in anger [G] 
I heard you [C] say [G]

[C] So [G] Sally can [Am] wait, she [E7] knows it's too [F] late
as she's [G] walking on [C] by [G]
Her [C] soul [G] slides a-[Am]way (stop)
But don't look [F/] back in anger
Don't look [Fm/] back in anger
I heard you [C] say  [G] [Am]  [E7] [F] [Fm] least not to-[C/]day
