Intro:
[Am]... [Am]... 

Now [Am] I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle V.I.-[E7]-P.
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what botherin' [Am] me
I wanna be a man, mancub,
And stroll right into [E7] town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyinâ€™ [Am/] around!

[G7/] Oh, [C] oo-bee-doo 
I wanna be like [A7] you 
I wanna [D7//] walk like you
[G7//] Talk like you [C//] too 

[G7//] You'll see it's [C] true
An ape like [A7] me
Can [D7//] learn to be [G7//] human [C] too

Now [Am] don't try to kid me mancub
I made a deal with [E7] you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come [Am] true
Give me the secret, mancub
Clue me what to [E7] do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like [Am/] you

[G7/] Oh, [C] oo-bee-doo 
I wanna be like [A7] you 
I wanna [D7//] walk like you
[G7//] Talk like you [C//] too 
[G7//] You'll see it's [C] true
Someone like [A7] me
Can [D7//] learn to be [G7//] like someone like [C] me
Can [D7//] learn to be [G7//] like someone like [C] you
Can [D7//] learn to be [G7//] like someone like [C] me-eee 
[G7/] [C/]
