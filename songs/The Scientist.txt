Intro:
[Dm]... [Bb]... [F]... [Fsus2]....

[Dm] Come up to [Bb] meet you, tell you I'm [F] sorry
You don't know how [Fsus2] lovely you are
[Dm] I had to [Bb] find you, tell you I [F] need you,
Tell you I set you [Fsus2] apart

[Dm] Tell me your [Bb] secrets and nurse me your [F] questions,
Oh lets go [Fsus2] back to the start
[Dm] Running in cir-[Bb]cles, comin' in [F] tails
Heads on a [Fsus2] science apart

[Bb] Nobody said it was easy,
[F] Oh it's such a [Fsus2] shame for us to part.
[Bb] Nobody said it was easy,  
[F] No one ever [Fsus2] said it would be this hard.
[C/] (stop) Oh take me back to the [F] start
[Bb]... [F]... [Fsus2]...

[Dm] I was just [Bb] guessin' at numbers and fi-[F]gures,
Pulling the [Fsus2] puzzles apart
[Dm] Questions of sci-[Bb]ence, science and pro-[F]gress
Don't speak as [Fsus2] loud as my heart

[Dm] And tell me you [Bb] love me, come back and [F] haunt me
Oh and I [Fsus2] rush to the start
[Dm] Runnin' in cir-[Bb]cles, Chasin' [F] tails
Comin' back as [Fsus2] we are

[Bb] Nobody said it was easy
[F] Oh it's such a [Fsus2] shame for us to part
[Bb] Nobody said it was easy
[F] No one ever [Fsus2] said it would be so hard
[C/] (stop) I'm going back to [F] the start.
 
[Bb]... [F]... [Fsus2]...
[Dm]... [Bb]... [F]... [Fsus2]...

[Dm] Ohh [Bb] uuuuhhhhh [F] [Fsus2]
[Dm] Ohh [Bb] uuuuhhhhh [F] [Fsus2]
[Dm] Ohh [Bb] uuuuhhhhh [F] [Fsus2]
[Dm] Ohh [Bb] uuuuhhhhh [F/]
