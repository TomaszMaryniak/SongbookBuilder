Intro: [Em /////5]

(pause) 
Hello darkness my old [D]friend
I’ve come to talk with you a[Em]gain 
Because a vision soft[C]ly [G]creeping
Left its seeds while I [C]was slee[G]ping
And the [C]vision that was planted in my [G]brain Still re[Em]mains
Within the [D]sound… of [Em]silence

(pause)
In restless dreams I walked a[D]lone
Narrow streets of cobbled [Em]stone
‘Neath the halo of [C]a street [G]lamp
I turned my collar to the [C]cold and [G]damp
When my [C]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon [G]light
That split the [Em]night [Em]
And touched the [D]sound… of [Em]silence

(pause)
And in the naked light I [D]saw
Ten thousand people maybe [Em]more
People talking with[C]out spea[G]king
People hearing with[C]out listen[G]ing
People writing [C]songs that voices never [G]share
And no one [Em]dare [Em] Disturb the [D]sound… of [Em]silence

(pause)
Fools said I, you do not [D]know. Silence like a cancer [Em]grows
Hear my words that I [C]might teach [G]you
Take my arms that I [C]might reach [G]you
But my [C]words like silent raindrops [G]fell [G]
And e[Em]choed In the [D]wells of [Em]silence

(pause)
And the people bowed and [D]prayed
To the neon God they [Em]made
And the sign flashed [C]its war[G]ning
In the words that it [C]was for[G]ming
And the sign said, the [C]words of the prophets are written on the
subway [G]walls. And tenement [Em]halls
And [Em]whispered… in the [D]sounds… of [Em/]silence
