Intro:
[Dm] [F] [Dm] [F]

[Dm/] Weep for yourself my man
[Dm/] You'll never be what is in your [F] heart
[Dm/] Weep little lion man
[Dm/] You're not as brave as you were at the [F] start
[C] Rate yourself and rake yourself
[Bb] Take all the courage you have [F] left
[C] Wasted on fixing all the [Bb] problems 
that you made in your own [F] head

But it was [Dm/] not your [Bb/] fault but [F] mine
And it was [Dm/] your heart [Bb/] on the [F] line
I really [Dm/] fucked it [Bb/] up this [F] time
Didn't I, my [C] dear?
Didn't I, my 

[Dm] dear? [F]... [Dm]... [F]...

[Dm/] Tremble for yourself, my man
[Dm/] You know that you have seen this all be[F]fore
[Dm/] tremble little lion man
[Dm/] You'll never settle any of your [F] scores
Your [C] grace is wasted in your face
Your [Bb] boldness stands alone among the [F] wreck
[C] Learn from your mother or else [Bb] spend your days biting your own [F] neck

But it was [Dm] not your [Bb] fault but [F] mine
And it was [Dm] your heart [Bb] on the [F] line
I really [Dm] fucked it [Bb] up this [F] time
Didn't I, my [C] dear?
But it was [Dm] not your [Bb] fault but [F] mine
And it was [Dm] your heart [Bb] on the [F] line
I really [Dm] fucked it [Bb] up this [F] time
Didn't I, my [C] dear?
Didn't I, my 

[Dm] dear? [F]... [Dm]... [F]...
[C]... [F]... [Bb]...
