Intro: [G] [G]

[G] She's got a smile that it seems to me   
Re[F]minds me of childhood memories   
Where [C] everything was as fresh as the bright blue [G] sky 
{c: } 
[G] Now and then when I see her face   
She [F] takes me away to that special place   
And if I [C] stared too long, I'd probably break down and [G] cry  
{c: } 
[D] Whoa-[F] oh, sweet child o' [G] mine   
[D] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [F] Oh sweet love [G] of mine  
{c: } 
[G] She's got eyes of the bluest skies   
As [F] if they thought of rain   
I [C] hate to look into those eyes and [G] see an ounce of pain   
Her [G]hair reminds me of a warm safe place   
Where [F] as a child I'd hide   
And [C] pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me [G] by  
{c: } 
[D] Whoa-[F] oh, sweet child o' [G] mine   
[D] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [F] Oh sweet love [G] of mine   
[D] Whoa-[F] oh, sweet child o' [G] mine   
[D] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [F] Oh sweet love [G] of mine
