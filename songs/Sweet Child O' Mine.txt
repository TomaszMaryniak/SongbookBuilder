Intro:
[C]

[C] She's got a smile that it seems to me   
Re[Bb]minds me of childhood memories   
Where [F] everything was as fresh as the bright blue [C] sky 
{c: } 
[C] Now and then when I see her face   
She [Bb] takes me away to that special place   
And if I [F] stared too long, I'd probably break down and [C] cry  
{c: } 
[G] Whoa-[Bb] oh, sweet child o' [C] mine   
[G] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [Bb] Oh sweet love [C] of mine  
{c: } 
[C] [Bb] [F] [C]
{c: }
[C] She's got eyes of the bluest skies   
As [Bb] if they thought of rain   
I [F] hate to look into those eyes and [C] see an ounce of pain   
Her [C]hair reminds me of a warm safe place   
Where [Bb] as a child I'd hide   
And [F] pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me [C] by  
{c: } 
[G] Whoa-[Bb] oh, sweet child o' [C] mine   
[G] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [Bb] Oh sweet love [C] of mine   
[G] Whoa-[Bb] oh, sweet child o' [C] mine   
[G] Whoa, Oh, Oh, [Bb] Oh sweet love [C] of mine
