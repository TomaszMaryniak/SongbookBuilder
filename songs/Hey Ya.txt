Ps: Every [D] is two strums, like [D//]

Intro: Shout: “1-2-3-uh”

[G] My baby don't [C]mess around
Because she loves me so and this I [D]know for [Em]sure
[G] But does she [C]really wanna
But cant stand to see me walk [D]out the [Em]door

[G] Don't try to [C]fight the feelin’
Cause the thought alone is killing [D]me right [Em]now
[G] Thank god for [C]mum and dad
For stickin’ through together cause we [D]don’t know [Em]how

(chorus)
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa

[G] You think you've got it… [C]oh you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it till there's [D]nothing at [Em]a-a-all
[G] We get together… [C]oh we get together
But separate's always better when there's [D]feelings in[Em]vo-o-olved

[G] If what they say is… [C]nothing is forever…
Then what makes, then what makes, then [D]what makes, then
[Em]what makes, then what makes… (huh) love the
Excep[G]tion? So why-you why-you… [C]why you why-you-why-you
Are we so in denial when we [D]know we’re not [Em/] (stop) happy he-e- ere

(chorus)
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa
[G]Heeeeeeeeeey [C]yaaaaaaa… [D]Hey [Em]yaaa

[G]Shake it… shake, shake it [C]shake it… shake, shake it
Shake it… shake, shake it… [D]shake it…
[Em]shake it… shake… shake it… shake it like a Polaroid

Shake it… shake… shake it… [D]shake it…
[Em]shake it… shake… shake it… shake it like a Polaroid
