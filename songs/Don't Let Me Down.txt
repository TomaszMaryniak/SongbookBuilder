Don't let me [Gsus2] down... don't let me [F] down
Don't let me [Gsus2] down, don't let me [F] down [riff] [stop]

Nobody ever loved me like she [Gsus2] does
Oh she does... yes she [F] does... [stop]

And if somebody loved me like she [Gsus2] does
Oh she does... yes she [F] does [riff] [stop]

Don't let me [Gsus2] down... don't let me [F] down
Don't let me [Gsus2] down, don't let me [F] down... [stop]

I'm in love for the first [F] time
Don't you know it's gonna [C] last
It's a love that lasts [C] forever
It's a love that had no [F] past [riff] [stop]

Don't let me [Gsus2] down... don't let me [F] down
Don't let me [Gsus2] down, don't let me [F] down... [stop]

And from the first time that she really [Gsus2] done me
Oh she done me, she done me [F] good... [stop]

I guess nobody ever really [Gsus2] done me
Oh she done me, she done me [F] good... [stop]

Don't let me [Gsus2] down... don't let me [F] down
Don't let me [Gsus2] down, don't let me [F] down ... [stop]
