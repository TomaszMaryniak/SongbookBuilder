Intro:
[Em]... [Em]... [Em]... [Em]...

[Em] She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the [Am] one
Who will dance on the floor in the [Em] round
 She said I am the [Am] one, who will dance on the floor in the [Em] round ...

[Em] She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the [Am] one
Who will dance on the floor in the [Em] round

(bridge)
[C] People always told me be [Em] careful of what you do
[C] Don't go around breaking young girls' [Em] hearts (Ihhhhhhh)

[C] And mother always told me be [Em] careful of who you love
[C] And be careful of what you do before the [B7] lie becomes the truth

(chorus)
[Em] Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the [Am] one
But the kid is not my [Em] son
She says I am the [Am] one
But the kid is not my [Em] son

[Em] For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side.
But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and [Am] plans.
'Cause we danced on the floor in the [Em] round
So take my strong [Am] advice, remember to always think [Em] twice
(Do think twice)

[Em] She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like [Am] mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the [Em] round

(bridge)
[C] People always told me be [Em] careful of what you do
Don't [C] go around breaking young girls' [Em] hearts (Ihhhhhhh)
Then she [C] stood right by me. The [Em] smell of sweet perfume.
This [C] happened much too soon. She [B7] called me to her room.

(chorus)
[Em] Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the [Am] one
But the kid is not my [Em] son
She says I am the [Am] one
But the kid is not my [Em] son
So take my strong [Am] advice, remember to always think [Em/] twice
