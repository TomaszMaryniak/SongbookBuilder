[D]... [Bm]... [Em]... [A]...

You used to get it in your [D/] fishnets
Now you only get it in your [Bm/] night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for [Em/] niceness
Landed in a very common [A/] crisis
Everything's in order in a [D] black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the [Bm] past though
The Bloody Mary's lacking her [Em] Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a [A] rascal?

Oh the boy's a [Em//] slag
The best you ever had [A//]
The best you ever had [Em//]
Is just a [A//] memory and [Em//] those dreams
But as daft as [A//] they seem
As daft as they [Em/] seem
My love when you [G/] dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of [D] sex tips
Remember when the boys were all [Bm] electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna [Em] get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just [A] forget it
                             
Clinging to not getting [D] sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she [Bm] went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be [Em//] gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh the boy's a [Em] slag
The best you ever [A] had
The best you ever [Em] had
Is just a [A] memory and [Em//] those dreams
But as daft as they [A//] seem
As daft as they [Em] seem
My love when you [G] dream them up

[F#m] Oh, where did you [Bm] go?
Where did you [Em] go?
Where did you [F#m] go? [Em] Woah...

[D] Falling about [Bm]
You took a [Em] left off Last [A] Laugh Lane
You were just [D] sounding it out [Bm]
You're not [Em] coming back [A] again.
