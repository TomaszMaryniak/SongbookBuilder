[D] When your legs don't work like they [G] used to be-[A]fore  
[D] And I can't  sweep you off of your [G] feet [A] 
[D] Will your  mouth still remember the [G] taste of my love [A] 
[D] Will your  eyes still smile [G] from your cheeks [A] 
{c: }                   
And darling [D] I  will be loving [G] you [A] 'til we're seven-[D]ty   [G] [A] 
And baby my [D]  heart could still fall [G] as [A] hard  at twenty[D]-three 
[G] And I'm thinking '[A] bout how 
{c: } 
[Em] People fall in love in mys-[A7]terious [D] ways
[Em] Maybe just the touch of a [A7] hand
Well [Em] me I fall in love with you [A7] every single [Bm] day 
[Em] And I just wanna [G] tell you I [A7] am
{c: }  
So honey [D] now  [Bm] [G] 
Take me [A] into your loving [D] arms [Bm] [G] 
Kiss me [A] under the light of a [D] thousand [Bm] stars  [G] 
Place your [A] head on my beating [D] heart [Bm] 
I'm thinking [G] out [A] loud
And maybe [Bm] we  [A] found [G] love [D] right [Em] where [A] we [D] are
{c: }
[D] And when my [D] head's over gone and my [G] memory fades [A]
[D] And the [D] crowds don't remember my [G] name [A] 
[D] When my [D] hands don't [G] play the strings the [A] same way, 
I know [D] you will still love me the[G] same [A] 
{c: }  
Cause honey [D] your soul could never [G] grow [A] old it's ever-[D]green  [Bm] [G] [A] 
And baby [D] your smile's forever [G] in my [A] mind and mem-[D]ory [Bm] [G] 
And I'm thinking [A] 'bout how
{c: }
[Em] People fall in love in mys-[A7]terious [D] ways
And [Em] maybe it's all part of a [A7] plan
Well [Em] I'll just keep on making the [A7] same mis-[Bm]stakes
[Em] Hoping that you'll under-[A7]stand
{c: }
That baby [D] now, [Bm] ooo[G] ooh
Take me [A] into your loving [D] arms [Bm] [G] 
Kiss me [A] under the light of a [D] thousand [Bm] stars  [G] 
Place your [A] head on my beating [D] heart [Bm] 
I'm thinking [G] out [A] loud
And maybe [Bm] we  [A] found [G] love [D] right [Em] where [A] we [D] are
