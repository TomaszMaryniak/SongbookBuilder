Intro [A] 8 beats

[A] Almost heaven… [F#m] West Virginia
[E] Blue ridge mountains [D]Shenandoah [A]river
[A] Life is old there [F#m]older than the trees
[E]Younger than the moun-tains… [D]blowing like a breeze [A]

Country [A]roads… take me [E7]home
To the [F#m]place… I be[D]long
West Vir[A]ginia… mountain ma[E]ma
Take me [D]home… country [A]roads

[A] All my memories… [F#m] gathered round her
[E] Miner’s lady… [D]stranger to blue [A]water
[A] Dark and dusty… [F#m]painted on the sky
[E]Misty taste of moonshine [D]teardrops in my [A]eye

Country [A]roads… take me [E7]home
To the [F#m]place… I be[D]long
West Vir[A]ginia… mountain ma[E]ma
Take me [D]home… country [A]roads

[F#m] I hear her [E7]voice in the [A]mornin’ hour she calls me
The [D]radio re[A]minds me of my [E]home far away
And [F#m]drivin’ down the [G]road I get a feel[D]in’ that I
[A]should have been home [E]yesterday… yester[E7]day

Country [A]roads… take me [E7]home
To the [F#m]place… I be[D]long
West Vir[A]ginia… mountain ma[E]ma
Take me [D]home… country [A]roads

Take me [E7]home… down country [A]roads
Take me [E7]home… down country [A]roads [A/]
