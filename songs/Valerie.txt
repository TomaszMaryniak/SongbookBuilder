[C]... [Dm]...
[C]... [Dm]... (stop)
				
Well some [C] times I go out by myself 
And I look across the [Dm] water ...   
And I [C] think of all the things, what you're doing    
And in my head I make a [Dm] picture ...

[F] 'Cos since I've come on home, 
Eell my [Em] body's been a mess   
And I've [F] missed your ginger hair 
And the [Em] way you like to dress   
[F] Won't you come on over, 
[C] stop making a fool out of [G] me
(stop)   
Why won't you come on over Vale[C]rie?  ...
Vale[Dm]rie ... Vale[C]rie? ... Vale[Dm]rie ...

(stop)  
Did you [C] have to go to jail, 
Put your house on up for sale    
Did you get a good [Dm] lawyer? 
I hope you [C] didn't catch a tan, 
I hope you find the right man    
Who'll fix it [Dm] for you ...

Are you [C] shopping anywhere, 
Changed the colour of your hair,    
Are you still [Dm] busy ...
And did you [C] have to pay the fine 
you were dodging all the time    
Are you still [Dm] dizzy? ...

[F] 'Cos since I've come on home, 
Well my [Em] body's been a mess   
And I've [F] missed your ginger hair 
And the [Em] way you like to dress   
[F] Won't you come on over, 
[C] stop making a fool out of [G] me ... 
Why won't you come on over Vale[C]rie? ...
Vale[Dm]rie ... Vale[C]rie? ... Vale[Dm]rie ...

(stop)
Well sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the water   
And I think of all the things, what you're doing    
and in my head I make a [Dm] picture   

[F] 'Cos since I've come on home
Well my [Em] body's been a mess   
And I've [F] missed your ginger hair 
And the [Em] way you like to dress

[C] Stop making a fool out of [G] me ...
