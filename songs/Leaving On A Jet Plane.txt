All my [G] bags are packed I'm [C] ready to go   
I'm [G] standing here out-[C]side your door   
I [G] hate to wake you [C] up to say good-[D7]bye   
But the [G] dawn is breakin' it's [C] early morn   
The [G] taxi's waitin' he's [C] blowin' his horn   
Al-[G]ready I'm so [C] lonesome I could [D7] cry   
{c: }    
So [G] kiss me and [C] smile for me   
[G] Tell me that you'll [C] wait for me   
[G] Hold me like you'll [C] never let me [D7] go   
I'm [G] leavin' [C] on a jet plane   
[G] Don't know when [C] I'll be back again   
[G] Oh [C] babe I hate to [D7] go   
{c: } 
There's so [G] many times I've [C] let you down   
[G] So many times I've [C] played around   
[G] I tell you now [C] they don't mean a [D7] thing   
Ev'ry [G] place I go I'll [C] think of you   
Ev'ry [G] song I sing I'll [C] sing for you   
When [G] I come back I'll [C] wear your wedding [D7] ring   
{c: } 
So [G] kiss me and [C] smile for me   
[G] Tell me that you'll [C] wait for me   
[G] Hold me like you'll [C] never let me [D7] go   
I'm [G] leavin' [C] on a jet plane   
[G] Don't know when [C] I'll be back again   
[G] Oh [C] babe I hate to [D7] go   
{c: } 
Now the [G] time has come for [C] me to leave you   
[G] One more time [C] let me kiss you   
Then [G] close your eyes, [C] I'll be on my [D7] way   
[G] Dream about the [C] days to come   
When [G] I won't have to [C] leave alone   
[G] About the times [C] I won't have to [D7] say   
{c: } 
So [G] kiss me and [C] smile for me   
[G] Tell me that you'll [C] wait for me   
[G] Hold me like you'll [C] never let me [D7] go   
I'm [G] leavin' [C] on a jet plane   
[G] Don't know when [C] I'll be back again   
[G] Oh [C] babe I hate to [D7] go   
{c: } 
I hate to [G] go ooo ooo
