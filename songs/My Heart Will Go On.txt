[G] Every night in [D] my dreams

[G] That is how I [D] know you go [C] on [D]   
{c: } 
[G] Far across the [D] distance    
And [C] spaces be[G]tween [D] us    
[G] You have come to [D] show you go [C] on [D]   
{c: } 
[Em] Near, [D]  far, wher[C]ever you [D] are    
I be[Em]lieve that the [D] heart does go [C] on [D]   
[Em] Once [D] more you [C] open the [D] door    
And you're [Em] here in my [D] heart    
And my [C] heart will go [D] on and [G] on

[G] Love can touch us [D] one time    
And [C] last for a [G] life[D]time    
And [G] never let [D] go till we're [C] gone [D]   
{c: } 
[G] Love was when I [D] loved you    
One [C] true time I [G] hold [D] to    
[G] In my life we'll [D] always go [G] on    
{c: }

I be[Em]lieve that the [D] heart does go [C] on [D]   
[Em] Once [D] more you [C] open the [D] door    
And you're [Em] here in my [D] heart    
And my [C] heart will go [D] on and [G] on   
{c: } 
[Em] You're [D] here, there's [C] nothing I [D] fear,    
And I [Em] know that my [D] heart will go [Em] on  [D]   
[Em] We'll [D] stay for[C]ever this [D] way    
You are [Em] safe in my [D] heart
