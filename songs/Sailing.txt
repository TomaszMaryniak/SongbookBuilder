I am [C] sailing, I am [Am] sailing    
home a[F]gain 'cross the [C] sea   
I am [D] sailing stormy [Am] waters,    
to be [Dm] near you, to be [C] free [G7]   
{c: } 
I am [C] flying, I am [Am] flying    
like a [F]bird 'cross the [C] sky   
I am [D] flying, passing [Am] high clouds,    
to be [Dm] near you, to be [C] free [G7]   
{c: } 
Can ya [C] hear me, can ya [Am] hear me,    
thru the [F] dark night far a[C]way?   
I am [D] dying, forever [Am] trying    
to be [Dm] with you; who can [C] say? [G7]
