| [C] [G]  | [Am] [F] |

[C] Oooo, [Em] oooo, [F] oooo [C] ...
[F] Oooo, [E7] oooo, [Am] oooo [F] ...
         
[C] Somewhere [Em] over the rainbow
[F]  Way up [C] high
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dream of           
[G] Once in a [Am] lullaby [F] -y-y ... y-y-y
             
Oh, [C] somewhere [Em] over the rainbow       
[F]  Blue birds [C] fly
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dream of                      
[G] Dreams really do come [Am] true [F] -ue-ue ... ooh-ooh-ooh

[C] Someday I'll wish upon a star
[G] Wake up where the clouds are far [Am] behind ... [F] me-e-e
Where [C] trouble melts like lemon drops
[G] High above the chimney tops                  
That's [Am] where ... you'll [F] fi-ind me

Oh, [C] somewhere [Em] over the rainbow       
[F]  Blue birds [C] fly
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dream of                       
Oh [G] why, oh why can't [Am] I-I-I ... [F]  Ah-ah-ay

[C] Someday I'll wish upon a star
[G] Wake up where the clouds are far [Am] behind ... [F] me-e-e
Where [C] trouble melts like lemon drops
[G] High above the chimney tops                  
That's [Am] where ... you'll [F] fi-ind me

Oh, [C] somewhere [Em] over the rainbow       
[F]  Blue birds [C] fly
[F] And the [C] dreams that you dream of                       
Oh [G] why, oh why can't [Am] I-I-I ... [F]  Ah-ah-ay

[C] Oooo, [Em] oooo, [F] oooo [C] ...
[F] Oooo, [E7] oooo, [Am] oooo [F] ...
