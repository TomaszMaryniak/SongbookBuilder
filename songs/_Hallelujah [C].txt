Intro: [C] [Am] [C] [Am] 

Well I've [C] heard there was a [Am] secret chord,   
That [C] David played and it [Am] pleased the Lord,   
But [F] you don't really [G] care for music, [C] do [G] ya?   
It [C] goes like this, the [F] 4th, the [G] 5th,    
the [Am] minor fall and the [F] major lift,   
The [G] baffled king com- [E7] posing halle- [Am] lujah, 
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]  
{c: } 
[C] [Am] [C] [Am] 

Your [C] faith was strong but you [Am] needed proof,    
You [C] saw her bathing [Am] on the roof,   
Her [F] beauty and the [G] moonlight over- [C] threw [G] ya,   
She [C] tied you to her [F] kitchen [G] chair,   
She [Am] broke your throne and she [F] cut your hair,   
And [G] from your lips she [E7] drew the halle- [Am]  lujah,  
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]  
{c: }  
[C] [Am] [C] [Am] 

May [C]be there is a [Am] God above,   
But [C] all I ever [Am] learned from love,   
Was [F] how to shoot at [G] someone who out- [C] drew [G] ya.   
And it's [C] not a cry you can [F] hear at [G] night,   
It's not [Am] somebody who's [F] seen the light,   
It's a [G] cold and it's a [E7] broken halle- [Am] lujah,  
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]  
{c: }   
[C] [Am] [C] [Am] 

I [C]  did my best, it  [Am]  wasn’t much,   
I [C]  couldn’t feel so I  [Am]  tried to touch,   
I’ve [F]  told the truth, I [G]  didn’t come to  [C]  fool [G]  ya.   
And [C]  even though it [F]  all went [G]  wrong,  
I’ll [Am]  stand before the  [F]  Lord of Song,   
With [G]  nothing on my  [E7]  tongue but  halle- [Am]  lujah,   
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]  
{c: }    
[C] [Am] [C] [Am] 

There [C]  was a time when you [Am]  let me know,   
What's [C]  really going [Am]  on below,   
But [F] now you [G] never show it to me [C] do [G]  ya.    
Well re-[C]member when I  moved [F] in with [G]  you,   
And the [Am]  holy dove was [F] moving too,   
And [G]  every breath we [E7]  drew was halle- [Am]  lujah  
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]  
{c: } 
Halle- [F] lujah, halle- [Am] lujah,    
halle- [F] lujah, halle [C] lu--- ---[G] jah [C]
