Intro: [C] [G] [Am] [F]

Well [C]you done done me and you bet I felt it
I [G]tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I [Am]fell right through the cracks… now I'm [F]trying to get back
Before the [C]cool done run out I'll be giving it my bestest
And [G]nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I [Am]reckon it's again my turn… to [F]win some or learn some

But [C]I… won't… he-si[G]tate… no… more
No… [Am]more… it… can-not [F]wait… I'm yours
[C] [G] [Am] [F]

[C] Well open up your mind… and see like [G]me
Open up your plans and damn you're [Am]free
Look into your heart and you'll find [F]love love love love
[C]Listen to the music of the moment people dance and [G]sing
We're just one big fami[Am]ly
And it's our godforsaken right to be [F]loved… loved loved loved [D7](single strum) loved (pause)

So [C]I… won't… he-si[G]tate… no… more
No… [Am]more… it… can-not [F]wait… I'm sure
There's no [C]need… to… com-pli[G]cate… our… time
Is [Am]short… this… is… our [F]fate… I'm yours

[C] [G] [Am] [G]
Scooch on over [F]closer dear
And I will nibble your [D7](single strum) ear

I've been spending [C]way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And [G]bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my [Am]breath fogged up the glass… and so I [F]drew a new face
and I laughed
I [C]guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reasons
To [G]rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's [Am]what we aim to do… our [F]name is our virtue

But [C]I… won't… he-si[G]tate no… more
No… [Am]more… it… can-not [F]wait… I'm yours
[C] Well open up your mind… and see like [G]me
Open up your plans and damn you're [Am]free
Look into your heart and you'll find that… [F] the sky is yours
So [C]please don't, please don't, please don't… there's no [G]ne-ed to
complicate
Cause our [Am]time is short… this is our, this is our [F]fate… I'm yours
[D7] (single strum) (pause)
[C] (single strum)
