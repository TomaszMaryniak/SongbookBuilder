[C] Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for [G] you,
And everything you [F] do,
Yeah, they were all yellow. [C] 

[C] I came along,
I wrote a song for [G] you,
And all the things you [F] do,
And it was called "Yellow".  [C] 

[C] So then I took my [G] turn,
Oh what a thing to have [F] done,
And it was all yellow.  [C] 

[F] Your skin, [Am] oh yeah your [G] skin and bones,
[F] Turn in-[Am]to something [G] beautiful,
[F] You seem to know, [Am] you know I [G] love you so, [F] 
[F] You know I love you so.

[C] [G] [F] [C] 
[C] I swam across,
I jumped across for [G] you,
Oh what a thing to [F] do.
Cos you were all yellow, [C]                                              

[C] I drew a line,
I drew a line for [G] you,
Oh what a thing to [F] do,
And it was all yellow.  [C]  [F]  [C]    

[F] Your skin, [Am] oh yeah your [G] skin and bones,
[F] Turn in-[Am]to something [G] beautiful,
[F] Coz you know, [Am] for you I'd [G] bleed my-self [F] dry,
[F] For you I'd bleed myself [C] dry.

[C] [G] [F] [C] 
It's [C] true,
Look how they shine for [G] you,
Look how they shine for [F] you,
Look how they shine [C] for, 
Look how they shine for [G] you,
Look how they shine for [F] you,
Look how they shine. [C]

Look how they shine for [Gm] you,
And all the things that you [F] do.
