Ps: if you want to simplify, play [G] instead of [Gsus4]

Intro: 
[G] [Gsus4]
{c: } 
It's not [G] time to make a [D] change just re[C]lax take it [Am] easy      
You're still [G] young that's your [Em] fault   
There's so [Am] much you have to [D] know   
Find a [G] girl settle [D] down if you [C] want you can [Am] marry   
Look at [G] me I am [Em] old but I'm [Am] happy [D]   
{c: } 
I was [G] once like you are [D] now   
And I [C] know that it's not [Am] easy   
To be [G] calm when you've [Em] found something going [Am] on [D]   
But take your [G] time think a [D] lot   
Why think of [C] everything you've [Am] got   
For you will [G] still be here to[Em]morrow   
But your [C] dreams may [G] not [Gsus4]  [G] [Gsus4]    
{c: } 
How can [G] I try to ex[D]plain   
When I [C] do he turns a[Am]way again   
It's [G] always been the [Em] same same old [Am] story [D]   
From the [G] moment I could [D] talk   
I was [C] ordered to [Am] listen now   
There's a [G] way and I [Em] know that I [C] have to go a[G]way   
I [D] know I [C] have to [G] go [Gsus4]  [G] [Gsus4]    
{c: } 
It's not [G] time to make a [D] change   
Just sit [C] down take it [Am] slowly   
You're still [G] young that's your [Em] fault   
There's so [Am] much you have to go [D] through   
Find a [G] girl settle [D] down if you [C] want you can [Am] marry   
Look at [G] me I am [Em] old but I'm [Am] happy [D]   
{c: } 
All the [G] times that I [D] cried   
Keeping [C] all the things I [Am] knew inside   
It's [G] hard but it's [Em] harder to ig[Am]nore it [D]   
If they were [G] right I'd a[D]gree   
But it's [C] them they know not [Am] me now   
There's a [G] way and I [Em] know   
That I [C] have to go a[G]way I [D] know I [C] have to [G] go
