Intro: [G] [D] [Em] [C]

I [G] heard that you're [D] settled down
That you [Em] found a girl, And you're [C] married now
I [G] heard that your [D] dreams came true
Guess she [Em] gave you things I didn't [C] give to you

Old [G] friend why are you so [D] shy
It ain't [Em] like you to hold back Or [C] hide from life

I [D] hate to turn up out of the [Em] blue uninvited
But [C] I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I'd [D] hoped you'd see my face
And [Em] that you'd be reminded
That for [C] me, it isn't [Cmaj7] over

[G] Never mind, I'll [D] find someone like [Em] you [C]
I wish [G] nothing but the [D] best for [Em] you [C] too
Don't [G] forget me I [D] beg, I re-[Em]-member you [C] said
Sometimes it [G] lasts in love, but [D] sometimes it hurts in-[Em]-stead [C]
Sometimes it [G] lasts in love, but [D] sometimes it hurts in-[Em]-stead, [C] yeah

[G] You'd know how [D] time flies
Only [Em] yesterday Was the [C] time of our lives
We were [G] born and raised In a [D] summer haze
Bound [Em] by the surprise Of our [C] glory days

I [D] hate to turn up out of the [Em] blue uninvited, but
[C] I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I'd [D] hoped you'd see my face And [Em] that you'd be reminded
That for [C] me, it isn't [Cmaj7] over

Chorus
[D] Nothing compares, no worries or cares
[Em] Regrets and mistakes, their memories make
[C] Who would have known how
Bitter-[Am]-sweet [Bm] this would [C] taste

Chorus x2

Sometimes it [G] lasts in love but [D] sometimes it hurts in-[Em]-stead [C]
Sometimes it [G] lasts in love but [D] sometimes it hurts in-[Em]-stead [C]
