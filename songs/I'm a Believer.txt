Intro: 
[G]

[G] I thought love was [D] only true in [G] fairy tales   
Meant for someone [D] else but not for [G] me. 
[C] Love was out to [G] get me   
[C] That's the way it [G] seemed.   
[C] Disappointment [G] haunted all my [D] dreams. [D] (stop)
   
(Chorus:)
Then I saw her [G] face, [C] Now I'm a be[G]liever! [C] 
Not a trace [G] [C] of doubt in my [G] mind. [C] 
[G] I'm in love [G/] (stop) oooohh  
[C/] I'm a be[G/]liever! I couldn't [F/] leave her if I [D] tried. [D]  

[G] I thought love was [D] more or less a [G] given thing,   
Seems the more I [D] gave the less I [G] got
