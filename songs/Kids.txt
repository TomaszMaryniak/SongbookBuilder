Crawling on your [A]knees toward him [E7]
[F#m] Making momma so [D]proud
[A] But your voice is too [E7]loud

[F#m] [D] We like to watch
[A]You laughing [E7]
[F#m] Picking insects off of [D]plants
[A] No time to think of conse[E7]quences

[F#m] Control yourself [D]
Take only what you [A]need from it [E7]
[F#m] A family of [D]trees wanting… to [A]be haunted [E7]

Like looking through a [A]fogged mirror [E7]

[A]thought… this wouldn't hurt a [E7]lot, I guess not
