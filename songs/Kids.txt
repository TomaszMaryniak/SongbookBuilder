[intro] [F#m] [D] [A] [E]

[F#m] You were a [D]child
Crawling on your [A]knees toward him [E]
[F#m] Making momma so [D]proud
[A] But your voice is too [E]loud

[F#m] [D] We like to watch
[A]You laughing [E]
[F#m] Picking insects off of [D]plants
[A] No time to think of consequences

[F#m] Control yourself [D]
Take only what you [A]need from it [E]
[F#m] A family of [D]trees wanting… to [A]be haunted [E]

[F#m] A family of [D]trees wanting… to [A]be haunted

[F#m] The water is [D]warm
But it's sending [A]me shivers [E]
[F#m] A baby is [D]born
[A] Crying out for atten[E]tion

[F#m] Memories [D]fade
Like looking through a [A]fogged mirror [E]
[F#m]Decisions too decisions are [D]made and not bought but I
[A]thought… this wouldn't hurt a [E]lot, I guess not

Take only what you [A]need from it [E]
[F#m] A family of [D]trees wanting… to [A]be haunted [E]
