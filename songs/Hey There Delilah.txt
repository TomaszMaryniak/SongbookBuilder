Intro:
[D] [F#m]
[D] [F#m]

[D] Hey there Delilah, what's it [F#m] like in New York City?
I'm a [D] thousand miles away but girl to-[F#m]night you look so pretty,
Yes you [Bm] do 
[G] Times Square can't [A] shine as bright as [Bm] you 
I swear it's [A] true
{c: }
[D] Hey there Delilah, don't you [F#m] worry about the distance,
I'm right [D] there if you get lonely, give this [F#m] song another listen, 
close your [Bm] eyes 
[G] listen to my [A] voice it's my dis-[Bm]guise 
I'm by your [A] side
{c: }
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, what you do to [D] me
{c: }
[D] Hey there Delilah, I know [F#m] times are getting hard,
But just be-[D]lieve me girl some day I'll pay the [F#m] bills with this guitar
We'll have it [Bm] good, 
[G] we'll have the [A] life we knew we [Bm] would 
My word is [A] good
{c: }
[D] Hey there Delilah, I've got [F#m] so much left to say,
If every [D] simple song I wrote to you, would [F#m] take your breath away,
I'd write it [Bm] all 
[G] even more in [A] love with me [Bm] you'd fall 
We'd have it [A] all
{c: }
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, what you  do to [D] me
{c: }
A [G] thousand miles seems pretty far, but [A] they've got planes and trains and cars, 
I'd [D] walk to you if I had no other [Bm] way 
Our [G] friends would all make fun of us, and [A] we'll just laugh along because we'd [D] know 
That none of them have felt this [Bm] way 
De-[G] lilah I can promise you, that [A] by the time that we get through, 
The [Bm] world will never ever be the [Bm] same 
And [A] you're to [A] blame 
{c: }
[D] Hey there Delilah you be good and [F#m] don't you miss me,
Two more [D] years and you'll be done with school, 
and [F#m] I'll be making history like I [Bm] do 
[G] You'll know it's [A] all because of [Bm] you 
[G] We can do what-[A]ever we want [Bm] to 
[G] Hey there De-[A]lilah here's to 
[Bm] you this oneâ€™s for [A] you
{c: }
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, 
[D] Oh it's what you do to [Bm] me, what you do to [D]* me
