(Am) (Dm) | (E7) (F-G) x2
(A) You could never know (D)what it's like
Your (E)blood li-ike winter freezes (A)just like ice
And there's (Bm7)cold lonely light that (D)shines from (E)you
You'll (F#m)wind up like the wreck you (D)hide behind that
(Bm)Mask you (A)use
(A) And did you think this fool could (D)never win
Well (E)look at me I'm a-comin' (A)back again
I got a (Bm7)taste of love in a (D)simple (E)way
And if you (F#m)need-to-know while I'm still sta-(D)-anding
You just (Bm)fade a(A)way… don’t you know
[chorus]
(Am7)I'm still (Am)standing better than
I (Em7)ever did… lookin' like
A (Dm)true survivor… feelin' like
A (F)little kid (G)
(Am7)I'm still (Am)standing after
(Em7)All this time
Pickin' up the (Dm)pieces of my life without you
(E7)On my mind
I'm still (Am)standing (Dm)yeah, yeah
(E7)Yeah
I'm still (Am)standing (Dm)yeah, yeah
(E7)Yeah (F-G)
(A) Once I never could've (D)hoped to win
You (E)starting down the road leaving (A)me again
The (Bm7)threats you made were meant to (D)cut me (E)down and if our
(F#m)Love was just a (D)circus you'd be
A (Bm)clown by (A)now
[chorus]
