Intro:
[Am] ... [C] ... [Em] ... [D] ... 

Like the legend of the [Am] phoenix [C] ...
All ends were be[Em]ginnings [D] ...
What keeps the planet [Am] spinning [C] (ah-ah)
The force from the beg[Em]inning [D] ...

[Am] We've… come too [C] far ...
To give [Em] up… who we [D] are
So [Am] let's… raise the [C] bar
And our [Em] cups… to the [D] stars

[Am] She's up all night 'til the sun… [C] I'm up all night to get some
[Em] She's up all night for good fun… [D] I'm up all night to get lucky
[Am] We're up all night 'til the sun… [C] we're up all night to get some
[Em] We're up all night for good fun… [D] we're up all night to get lucky
[Am] We're up all night to get lucky… [C] we're up all night to get lucky
[Em] We're up all night to get lucky… [D] we're up all night to get lucky
[Am] ... [C] ... [Em] ... [D] ...

The present has no [Am] rhythm [C] ...
Your gift keeps on [Em] giving [D] ...
What is this I'm [Am] feeling? [C] ...
If you want to leave I'm [Em] with it [D] (ah-ah)

[Am] We've… come too [C] far
To give [Em] up… who we [D] are
So [Am] let's… raise the [C] bar
And our [Em] cups… to the [D] stars

[Am] She's up all night 'til the sun… [C] I'm up all night to get some
[Em] She's up all night for good fun… [D] I'm up all night to get lucky
[Am] We're up all night 'til the sun… [C] we're up all night to get some
[Em] We're up all night for good fun… [D] we're up all night to get lucky
[Am] We're up all night to get lucky… [C] we're up all night to get lucky
[Em] We're up all night to get lucky… [D] we're up all night to get lucky
