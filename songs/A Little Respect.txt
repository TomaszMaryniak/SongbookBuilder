[C/] [stop]

I try to dis[C]cover
A little something to [G] make me sweeter
Oh baby ref[E7]rain… from breaking my [F] heart [stop]

I’m so in [C] love with you
I’ll be for[G]ever blue
That you give me no [F] reason
Why you’re making me [Am] work so hard

(single strums)
[G/] That you give me no [G/] that you give me no
[G/] That you give me no [G/] that you give me no

[C] Soul… I hear you [Am] calling
Oh baby [F] please… give a little res[Em]pect 
[F] to-[G]-oo [C] meeee [C] [stop]

And if I should [C] falter
Would you open your [G] arms out to me
We can make love not [E7] war
And live at peace with out [F] hearts [stop]

I’m so in [C] love with you
I’ll be for[G] ever blue
What religion or [F] reason
Could drive a man to for[Am]sake his lover

[G/] Don’t you tell me no [G/] don’t you tell me no
[G/] Don’t you tell me no [G/] don’t you tell me no
