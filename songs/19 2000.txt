Intro: 
[G] [G] [F] [G] 

[G] The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To [F] keep myself tethered
To the [G] days I tried to lose

[G] My mamma said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
And [F] stop dancing to the music
[G] Of Gorillaz in a happy mood. 

[G] Deee duuu bop 
[F] Deee duuu bop 
[C] Deee duuu bop
[G] Deee duuu bop

[G] Get the cool
[F] Get the cool shoeshine
[C] Get the cool
[G] Get the cool shoeshine 

[G] Get the cool
[F] Get the cool shoeshine
[C] Get the cool
[G] Get the cool shoeshine 

[G] [F] [C] [G] 

[G] There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught [F] up in the conflict
Between his [G] brain and his tail

[G] And if time's elimination
Then we've got nothing to lose
[F] Please repeat the message
It's the [G] music that we choose

[G] Deee duuu bop 
[F] Deee duuu bop 
[C] Deee duuu bop
[G] Deee duuu bop

(chorus)
[G] Get the cool
[F] Get the cool shoeshine
[C] Get the cool
[G] Get the cool shoeshine 

[G] Get the cool
[F] Get the cool shoeshine
[C] Get the cool
[G] Get the cool shoeshine
