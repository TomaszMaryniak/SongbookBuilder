[Am] On a dark desert highway [E7] cool wind in my hair   
[G] Warm smell of colitas [D] rising up through the air   
[F] Up ahead in the distance [C] I saw a shimmering light   
[Dm] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim   
[E7] I had to stop for the night   
{c: } 
[Am] There she stood in the doorway [E7] I heard the mission bell   
[G] And I was thinking to myself this could be [D] heaven or this could be hell   
[F] Then she lit up a candle [C] and she showed me the way   
[Dm] There were voices down the corridor [E7] I thought I heard them say

[Am] Her mind is Tiffany twisted [E7] she got the Mercedes bends   
[G] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [D] that she calls friends   
[F] How they dance in the courtyard [C] sweet summer sweat   
[Dm] Some dance to remember [E7] some dance to forget   
[Am] So I called up the captain [E7] please bring me my wine   
He said [G] we haven't had that spirit here since [D] 1969   
[F] And still those voices are calling from [C] far away   
[Dm] Wake you up in the middle of the night [E7] just to hear them say

And she said [G] we are all just prisoners here [D] of our own device   
[F] And in the master's chambers [C] they gathered for the feast   
[Dm] They stab it with their steely knives but they [E7] just can't kill the beast
