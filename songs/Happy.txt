(Intro: 5 single strums)
[E7/] [E7/] [E7/] [E7/] [E7/]

(mute) It might seem crazy what I'm about to say [E7]
(mute) Sunshine she's here, you can take a break [E7] 
(mute) I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space [E7] 
(mute) With the air, like I don't care baby by the way [E7]

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7] do

(mute) Here come bad news talking this and that [E7]
(mute) Give me all you got, don’t hold it back [E7]
(mute) Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine [E7]
(mute) No offense to you don’t waste your time [E7]

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7] do

([E7] throughout...)
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down, Love is too high
Bring me down, can't noth'ng 
Bring me down I said, let me tell you now
bring me down, can't noth'ng 
bring me down, Love is too high
bring me down, can't noth'ng
bring me down, I said

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7/] do
