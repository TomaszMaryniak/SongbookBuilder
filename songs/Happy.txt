[E7] It might seem crazy what I'm about to say 
[E7] Sunshine she's here, you can take a break 
[E7] I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space 
[E7] With the air, like I don't care baby by the way 

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7] do

[E7] Here come bad news talking this and that
[E7] Give me all you got, don’t hold it back
[E7] Well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
[E7] No offense to you don’t waste your time (here's why)

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7] do

([E7] throughout...)
Bring me down, can't noth'ng
Bring me down, Love is too high
Bring me down, can't noth'ng 
Bring me down I said, let me tell you now
(Happy, happy, happy, happy), bring me down, can't noth'ng 
(Happy, happy, happy, happy), bring me down, Love is too high
(Happy, happy, happy, happy), bring me down, can't noth'ng 
(Happy, happy, happy, happy), bring me down, I said

(Chorus:)                                                    
Because I'm [C] happy clap along [Bm7] if you feel like a room without a [E7] roof
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like happiness is the [E7] truth
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you know what happiness is to [E7] you
Because I'm [C] happy, clap along [Bm7] if you feel like that's what you wanna [E7] do
