A-[C]mazing grace how [F] sweet the [C] sound 
that saved a wretch like [G7] me.    
I [C] once was lost, but [F] now am [C] found,  
was blind but [G7] now I [C] see.   
{c: } 
`Twas [C] grace that taught my [F] heart to [C] fear,     
and grace my fears re-[G7]lieved.   
How [C] precious did that [F] grace [C] appear,  
the hour I [G7] first be-[C]lieved.    
{c: } 
When [C] we’ve been there ten [F] thousand
[C] years bright shining as the [G7] sun   
We’ve [C] no less days to [F] sing God’s [C] praise,    
Than when  we  [G7] first be-[C]gun.   
{c: } 
Through [C] many dangers, [F] toils and [C] snares,
I have already [G7] come.   
`Tis [C] grace hath brought me [F] safe thus [C] far,     
and grace will [G7] lead me [C] home.
