Intro:
[A7//] [Cm//] [G//] [G//]
[A7//] [Cm//] [G//] [G//]

You're just too [G] good to be true   
Can't take my [Gmaj7] eyes off you   
You'd be like [G7] heaven to touch    
I wanna [C] hold you so much    
At long last [Cm] love has arrived    
And I thank [G] God I'm alive    
You're just too [A7//] good to be true     
[Cm//] Can't take my [G] eyes off you

Pardon the [G] way that I stare    
There's nothing [Gmaj7] else to compare    
The sight of [G7] you leaves me weak    
There are no [C] words left to speak    
So if you [Cm] feel like I feel    
Please let me [G] know that it's real    
You're just too [A7//] good to be true
[Cm//] Can't take my [G] eyes off you   

(Sing Da Da, Da Da)   
[Am//] [D7//] [G//] [G//]
[Am//] [D7//] [G//] [E7] (stop)

I love you [Am] baby and if it's [D7] quite all right    
I need you [G] baby to warm the [Em7] lonely nights    
I love you [Am] baby, [D7] trust in me when I [G] say [E7]
Oh pretty [Am] baby, don't bring me [D7] down I pray    
Oh pretty [G] baby, now that I've [Em7] found you stay    
And let me [Am] love you baby, let me [Cm/] love you (stop)

You're just too [G] good to be true

I wanna [C] hold you so much    
At long last [Cm] love has arrived    
And I thank [G] God I'm alive
