[Am] Strumming my pain with his [Dm] fingers   
[G7] Singing my life with his [C] words   
[Am] Killing me softly with [D] his song   
Killing me [G] softly with [F] his song   
Telling my [C] whole life with [F] his words   
Killing me [Asus4] softly with his [A] song  
{c: } 
[Dm] I heard he [G7] sang a good song   
[C] I heard he [F] had a style   
[Dm] And so I [G7] came to see him   
And [Am] listen for a while   
[Dm] And there he [G7] was this young boy   
[C] A stranger [E7] to my eyes

[Am] Strumming my pain with his [Dm] fingers   
[G7] Singing my life with his [C] words   
[Am] Killing me softly with [D] his song   
Killing me [G] softly with [F] his song   
Telling my [C] whole life with [F] his words   
Killing me [Asus4] softly with his [A] song  
{c: } 
[Dm] I felt all [G7] flushed with fever   
[C] Embarrassed [F] by the crowd   
[Dm] I felt he [G7] found my letters   
And [Am] read each one out loud   
[Dm] I prayed that [G7] he would finish   
[C] But he just [E7] kept right on

[Dm] He sang as [G7] if he knew me   
[C] In all my [F] dark despair   
[Dm] And then he [G7] looked right through me   
As [Am] if I wasn't there    
[Dm] And he just [G7] kept on singing   
[C] Singing [E7] clear and strong
