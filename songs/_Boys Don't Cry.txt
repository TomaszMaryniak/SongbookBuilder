[A/]... [Bm/]... [C#m/]... [D/]...

[A] Bm
I would say I?m sorry
C#m D
If I thought that it would change your mind
[A] Bm
But I know that this time
C#m
I?ve said too much
D
Been too unkind

[A] Bm
I try to laugh about it
[A] Bm
Cover it all up with lies
[A]
I try and
Bm
Laugh about it
[A] Bm
Hiding the tears in my eyes
[A] Bm C#m D 
�cause boys don?t cry
[A] Bm C#m D 
Boys don?t cry

[A] Bm
I would break down at your feet
C#m
And beg forgiveness
D
Plead with you
[A]
But I know that
Bm
It?s too late
C#m D
And now there?s nothing I can do
[A] Bm
So I try to laugh about it
[A] Bm
Cover it all up with lies
[A]
I try to
Bm
laugh about it
[A] Bm
Hiding the tears in my eyes
