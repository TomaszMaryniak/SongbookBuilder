Intro: [A] [Bm] [D] [A]  x2

[A] Twenty five years and my life is still
[Bm] Trying to get up that great big hill of [D] hope
For a desti-[A]nation
{c: }
[A] I realized quickly when I knew that I should
That the [Bm] world was made of this brotherhood - of [D] man
Or whatever that [A] means
{c: }
[A] And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to [Bm] get it all out whats in my head 
And I, [D] I am feeling a little pe-[A]culiar.
{c: }
[A] So I wake in the morning and I step outside
and I [Bm] take a deep breath and I get real high and
I [D] scream at the top of my lungs  - WHATS GOIN [A] ON?
{c: }
[A] And I say: hey yeah yeaaah, [Bm] hey yeah yea, I said [D] hey, what's going [A] on?
[A] And I say: hey yeah yeaaah, [Bm] hey yeah yea, I said [D] hey, what's going [A] on?
{c: }
[A] ooh, ooh [Bm] oooooooooooooooo  [D] oooooooooooo [A] ooo
{c: }
[A] And I cry, oh My God do I [Bm] cry, I cry all the [D] time in this insti-[A]tution
[A] And I pray, oh My God do I [Bm] pray, I pray for sancti[D]ty for a revo-[A]lution.
{c: }
[A] And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed 
Just to [Bm] get it all out what's in my head
And I, [D]  I am feeling a little pe-[A]culiar.
{c: }
[A] And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I [Bm] take a deep breath and I get real high
And I [D] scream from the top of my lungs - WHATS GOIN [A] ON?
